            <h3>Using the right social media strategy can be a game changer for your brand as it will help you reach your audience effectively. Let’s look at a few success stories: </h3>
            <p >
            In 2013, Spotify introduced its "Year in Review" feature. The company realized it had a treasure trove of streaming data. While the graphics were on-brand
             and less quirky than today’s versions, they still captured the audience’s attention.  
            </p>
            Fast-forward to 2016, Spotify rebranded these data stories as "Wrapped." Each year, Spotify Wrapped introduces new and fun features based on users’ listening habits — 
            from identifying your unique “audio aura” to categorizing you into one of 16 “listening personality types.”
