            With over 10 years of research and scientific experimentation, Vadiance has set the stage to benefit humanity by creating
             a supplement that generates Vital Life Force Energy by enhancing the one thing humans need to survive: water.  With the 
             goal of improving peopleâ€™s quality of life by creating inner balance and harmony, Vadiance set out to offer their unique
              water supplement online through an ecommerce website. 
             They got the traffic to their poorly designed website, but the conversion of site visitors to customers was not happening.
